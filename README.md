'Chile Viajes' Proyect.

A example landpage for travel agencies.
The instructions for this proyect was provided by 'Desaf√≠o Latam'.
In this proyect there is Bootstrap 5 elements like a 'Navbar', a 'Carousel', some 'Cards', a 'Form' and usage of the 'Containers', 'Grid' and 'Columns' in a way to get better responsivity.
This proyect was made for x-small, medium and large viewports.
This is my first proyect as student in the Fullstack developer bootcamp by Edutecno.
